		<h1>CC: Radare2 Writeup</h1>
		<a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/ccradare2">Link to the room</a>
		<p>Hello there. This is the first time I'm doing a writeup so excuse if things aren't well explained or poorly structured.
			Reverse engineering is a hard subject to get into specially when attemping to reverse engineer binaries without any sense of direction. </p>
		<p>So I'll do my best to explain every task along with plenty of screenshots/snippets so you can see exactly what's going on and how to get there
			on your own.</p> 

		<p>For those new to RE, if you don't know what binaries mean, they're specifically the machine executable part of a program/app that you'll be looking into and see
				if you can discover something interesting. Basically a fancy term for an executable. A program like radare2 will do its best to disassemble a binary and gives us information on its inner workings, like function names, strings, assembly instructions and much more. </p>

		<p>This writeup will skip most exercises where you simply use the help function but I can answer some with a different take or the ones
			that were more trouble for me.</p>

			
		<p>Anyway let's get started.</p>
		
		<p>First of all let's download the files that the room provides and put them in a folder for us to work with.</p>
		
		<p>To start up RE-ing generally you'll be using radare2 with this command</p>
		<pre>$ radare2 -d &ltbinary-name&gt</pre>
		<p>radare2 can also be shortned to just r2.</p>
		<p><u>Note</u>: Binaries must be executable. Although the files that the room provides are ready to be used, if they weren't, you'd have to add permissions 
			in order for you to start RE-ing.
		<pre>$ chmod +x &ltbinary-name&gt</pre>
		<hr>

		<h2>[Task 2]</h2>

		<p>All of these can be solved with </p>

		<pre>$ r2 --help</pre>

		<h2>[Task 3]</h2>
		<h3>#4</h3>
		<p>Let's load up the example1 binary.</p>
		<pre>
$ r2 -d example1
<span class="radare2">[0x00000530]></span> aaa
<span class="radare2">[0x00000530]></span> afl</pre>

		<pre>
0x560c5a7c5530    1 42           entry0
0x560c5a9c5fd8    1 4132         reloc.__libc_start_main
0x560c5a7c5560    4 50   -> 44   sym.deregister_tm_clones
0x560c5a7c55a0    4 66   -> 57   sym.register_tm_clones
0x560c5a7c55f0    5 50           entry.fini0
0x560c5a7c5520    1 6            sym.imp.__cxa_finalize
0x560c5a7c5630    4 48   -> 42   entry.init0
0x560c5a7c54f8    3 23           sym._init
0x560c5a7c56e0    1 1            sym.__libc_csu_fini
0x560c5a7c56e4    1 9            sym._fini
0x560c5a7c566b    1 7            sym.secret_func
0x560c5a7c5680    4 93           sym.__libc_csu_init
0x560c5a7c5660    1 11           main</pre>
		
		<p>Although you could easily count the functions one by one I wasn't satifised doing this way. </p>
		<p>Thankfully, radare2 provides an easy way to count number of lines by simply appending "~?" to any command. 
		
		There's also another way which personally I find better since you can use this for other bash commands.
		</p>
		<pre><span class="radare2">[0x133713371337]></span> afl | wc -l</pre>

		<p>For some reason, the count that I got is 1 more than the answer. I don't know what caused this, either one of the functions
		is not really a function, or the answer was done from a more recent version of radare2 where the analysis counts less functions or something like that.
		</p>
		
		<h3>#5</h3>
		<p>When you're answering this, don't include sym.</p>
		<p>Also, whenever you're doing a RE challenge, be on the lookout for functions that are in exactly this format. (no additional underscores or strings)</p>
		<pre>sym.user_func</pre>

		<h2>[Task 4]</h2>

		<h3>#2 and #6</h3>
		<p>A cool tip whenever you're searching for a string is to hide the excess information that you might not want at first.</p>
		<p>Appending qq to most r2 commands will greatly reduce the amount of information shown at once. </p>
		<p>This applies really well to the command that shows strings and it's very useful to know.</p>
		<pre><span class="radare2">[0x133713371337]></span> izzqq</pre></pre>

		<h2>[Task 6]</h2>

		<h3>#2</h3>
		<p>This answer really confused me at first and I spent a good chunk of time looking through every option in the p? list</p>
		<p>Basically dissassembly means assembly instructions or opcodes.</p>
		<p>Which then we can see the answer by looking at "disassemble N opcodes (pd) or N bytes (pD)"</p>

		<h3>#4</h3>
		<p>Unfortunately this command doesn't seem to work for me :(</p>
		<img src="1.PNG">
		<p>Anyway this command is very sneakily hidden and you wouldn't find it normally unless you google it.</p> 
		<p>It can be found by using "px?"</p>

		<h3>#6 and #7</h3>
		<p>Let's finally look at some assembly code!</p>
		<p>As usual whenever you're loading up a different binary, remember to run aaa first.</p>
